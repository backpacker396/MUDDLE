Ti[f]{2,}fany in a tiny, dull font. One [eye][I] dotted with stab wounds the other a tiny red heart. The same name illuminates the night stand, interrupting your smooth darkness with her glaring eyes... 

She means nothing to you, right?

Mute. Screen brightness dimmed. 

Turns over. 

Now I can only see "any"...and I'm reminded he is anyone's but mine yet demands for me to only be his.

SO a silent night insues, 

...for you, but I can still see her glow beneath the pillow.

YOU CAN'T BURY HER THERE! I'm the one to change the sheets. And you can't DROWN out my thoughts with your fake snores.

Heavy, squinted eyes of envy - now your neck reads "many" and I know you'll never read this. There are just too many other eyes you like to dot... 

with late night tears over your tiny red heart as you rest in peace.
