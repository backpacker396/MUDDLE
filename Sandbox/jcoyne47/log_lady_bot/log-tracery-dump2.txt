"30s":["No. ","Pie. ","Colors. ","Shapes. ","A hotel. ","Painting. ","Textures. ","Contrast. ","I think so. ","I think not. ","Hello again. ","Composition. ","I had a dog. ","A death mask. ","A nightstand. ","One more thing. ","The revelation. ","It is not to me. ","What do you see? ","I think it does. ","My love is gone. ","How can this be? ","Are they mirrors? ","Is life a puzzle? ","I chew pitch gum. ","Yes, now we know. ","I am my own judge. ","Nothing is simple. ","The dog was large. ","I carry a log, yes. ","Is it funny to you? ","Some take the time. ","The tears are real. ","Look in the mirror. ","As above, so below. ","Is there an answer? ","Of course there is. ","Balance is the key. ","What is the secret? ","And now, an ending. ","I can see the smoke. ","I can smell the fir. ","Letters are symbols. ","Let nature guide us. ","Again I wonder: why? ","It would be so near. ","A chance to see two? ","Yes, it is a dilemma. ","Repetition of shapes. ","Who is the principal? ","What is a reflection? ","Things like the truth. ","What is a drawer pull? ","It exists to be found. ","That would be strange. ","I hope Norma likes me. ","I grew up in the woods. ","He was black and white. ","I do love Norma's pies. ","I love pie with coffee. ","We do not want to be us. ","Yet, I feel him near me. ","Here was a great person. ","Am I being too secretive? ","Different aspects of you? ","This is the pitch I chew. ","Do we understand balance? ","So now the sadness comes. ","Whoever invented the pie? ","Or were there always two? ","Do answers come in dreams? ","My husband died in a fire. ","No one can know my sorrow. ","Thousands, maybe millions? ","Are they called detectives? ","The battle is drawing nigh. ","Can you see through a wall? ","I am filled with questions. ","A poem as lovely as a tree. ","Is a dog man’s best friend? ","This was not a forest fire. ","It was a fire in the woods. ","Are blood and love related? ","What really is creamed corn? ","Nature is the great teacher. ","Sometimes jokes are welcome. ","I have a memory of this dog. ","A drawer pull on the drawer. ","Many things I, I musn't say. ","It is too difficult to be us. ","Is life like a game of chess? ","This was not a friendly fire. ","A log is a portion of a tree. "],
"60s":["Behind all things are reasons. ","The answer, of course, is yes. ","One day, the sadness will end. ","Is it a dream, or a nightmare? ","Languages help us communicate. ","It was almost fun not knowing. ","I think we all know it exists. ","These ideas speak so strangely. ","I play my part on life's stage. ","Life, like music, has a rhythm. ","Can you see through human skin? ","Runny pitch is no good to chew. ","Hard, brittle pitch is no good. ","Sometimes I can almost see him. ","Are you proud of your behavior? ","But the puzzle maker is clever. ","Its body went back to the earth. ","Watch, and see what life teaches. ","What is this thing called a tear? ","Is this a key to life in general? ","Are you ashamed of your behavior? ","There will never be a fire there. ","Is it a symbol for something else? ","Balance is the key to many things. ","Is the cart in front of the horse? ","The dog ate so much earth it died. ","This is all I am permitted to say. ","Is love the blood of the universe? ","I know I like her and respect her. ","My log hears things I cannot hear. ","Is there a reason for a death mask? ","Reasons can even explain the absurd. ","Then the day when the sadness comes. ","Then we wonder: where is the beauty? ","Sometimes my questions are answered. ","Our world is a magical smoke screen. ","Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. ","We always seem to want more and more. ","The word 'balance' has seven letters. ","But there is still the question, why? ","How beautiful it is to find treasure. ","Woe to ones who behold the pale horse. ","The fire I speak of is not a kind fire. ","Yet there are those who open many eyes. ","Love, like blood, flows from the heart. ","It has been a pleasure speaking to you. ","There is none, if the eyes are soulless. ","It was just the principal of the thing. ","So sadness in our ignorance is very real. ","Are we being introduced against our will? ","Why are some things kept from our vision? ","Sometimes we want to hide from ourselves. ","Complications set in--yes, complications. ","Does a heart pump blood as it pumps love? ","Sometimes my anger at the fire is evident. ","When I see a fire, I feel my anger rising. ","How many drawer pulls exist in this world? ","How do you treat your fellow human beings? ","There are clues everywhere, all around us. ","We live in a world where nothing is simple. ","An evil man has a way, no matter how clever. ","Or the case of the two-headed schizophrenic? ","How many times have we heard: 'it's simple'. ","Just notice that my fireplace is boarded up. ","Where there was once one, there are now two. ","Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. ","I tell what I can to form the perfect answer. ","To the trained eye, his way will show itself. ","The memory is all that I have left of my dog. ","In my heart, I can tell the answer is correct. ","In a dream, are all the characters really you? ","I understand many things because of the woods. ","Are our appetites, our desires undermining us? ","Yes – we are ignorant of many beautiful things. ","There is a depression after an answer is given. ","Some say it is inside us--inside us one and all. ","Letters and words, calling out for understanding. ","Anger is usually present in arguments and fights. ","At least we know what we sought in the beginning. ","It ate my garden, all the plants, and much earth. ","The heart -- it is a physical organ, we all know. ","Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. ","Both heads thought the other was following itself. ","One can never answer questions at the wrong moment. ","Are our present moves important for future success? ","Only when we are everywhere will there be just one. ","There are, of course, the pros and cons of division. ","We paint our future with every present brush stroke. ","Sometimes ideas, like men, jump up and say, 'Hello!'  ","X-rays see through solid, or so-called solid objects. ","A drawer pull of a nightstand in the room of a hotel. ","The beautiful thing about treasure is that it exists. ","Sometimes I get angry and do things I'm not proud of. ","Each ring represents one year in the life of the tree. ","Like the one about the kid who said: 'I enjoyed school.' ","The human being finds himself, or herself, in the middle. ","Food is interesting; For instance, why do we need to eat? ","And yet, who could throw away the casting of a loved one? ","Sometimes, well let’s say all times, things are changing. ","The world could break apart with sadness in the meantime. ","All that we see in this world is based on someone's ideas. ","Is there a bigger being walking with all the stars within? ","But how much more an emotional organ -- this we also know. ","A death mask is almost an intrusion on a beautiful memory. ","You know in your heart if you have hurt someone, you know. ","But my log tells me about the sounds, about the new words. ","They are building blocks of words, which form our language. ","Sometimes when we are ill, we are not on our best behavior. ","Then the knowing is so full there is no room for questions. ","What could possibly be happening on or in this drawer pull? ","Then why is it so hard to find, and so difficult to attain? ","Even though it has stopped growing larger, my log is aware. "],
"90s":["I can say it again: Some ideas arrive in the form of a dream. ","Have you ever seen something startling that others cannot see? ","Anger is an emotion, usually classified as a negative emotion. ","What is the secret to simplicity, to the pure and simple life? ","Even the ones who laugh are sometimes caught without an answer. ","In Twin Peaks, we specialize in cherry pie and huckleberry pie. ","Where does creamed corn figure into the workings of the universe? ","And this question will go on and on until the final answer comes. ","At night when the wind blows, I think of what he might have been. ","There are things in life that exist, yet our eyes cannot see them. ","Can a victim of power end, in any way, connected to a drawer pull? ","Where is the treasure, that when found, leaves one eternally happy? ","They introduce themselves, these ideas, with words – are they words? ","There is a sadness in this world, for we are ignorant of many things. ","There is as much space outside the human, proportionately, as inside. ","On the mantelpiece, in that jar, are some of the ashes of my husband. ","We are judged as human beings on how we treat our fellow human beings. ","Stars, moons, and planets remind us of protons, neutrons, and electrons. ","A wise person once said with a smile, the answer is within the question. ","At the end of a crosscut log -- many of you know this -- there are rings. ","How long it takes to a grow a tree! I don't mind telling you some things. ","When there are chances for reflections, there can always be two--or more. ","Trees standing together, growing alongside one another, providing so much. ","Seven is difficult to balance, but not impossible – we are able to divide. ","If you have hurt someone, don’t wait another day before making things right. ","The clues, although surrounding us, are somehow mistaken for something else. ","Does our thinking affect what goes on outside us, and what goes on inside us? ","When eating too much the proper balance is disturbed, and ill health follows. ","Do we have the time to learn the reasons behind human beings' varied behavior? ","This particular song will end with three sharp sounds, like deathly drumbeats. ","On the outside – let's say, of the Ponderosa pine – sometimes pitch oozes out. ","But in between these exists a firm, slightly crusted pitch with such a flavor. ","And the something else, the wrong interpretation of the clues, we call our world. ","Sometimes it is not anger, really – it may appear as such, but could it be a clue? ","Miscommunication sometimes leads to arguments, and arguments sometimes lead to fights. ","There are even tiny ducts – tear ducts – to produce these tears should the sadness occur. "],
"180s":["Negative emotions can cause severe problems in our environment and to the health of our body. ","These creatures who introduce themselves, but we swear we have met them somewhere before, yes? ","Who would not want to study it longingly, as the distance freight train blows its mournful tone? ","At night, just before sleep, as you lay by yourself in the dark, how do you feel about yourself? ","A drunken man walks in a way that is quite impossible for a sober man to imitate, and vice versa. ","Sometimes nature plays tricks on us and we imagine we are something other than what we truly are. ","I have spit my pitch gum out of my mouth onto her walls and floors and sometimes onto her booths. ","It is at these times that we turn to drugs and alcohol or behavior to forget that we are ourselves. ","How should we interpret the happy song of the meadowlark or the robust flavor of a wild strawberry? ","Even with complicated languages used by intelligent people, misunderstanding is a common occurrence. ","Why are we never satisfied with just the right amount of food to maintain good health and proper energy? ","But that answer cannot come before all are ready to hear, so I tell what I can to form the perfect answer. ","By ill, I mean any of the following: physically ill, emotionally ill, mentally ill, and/or spiritually ill. ","It is barely a physical resemblance--in death, the muscles so relaxed, the face so without the animating spark. ","'Eyes are the mirror of the soul,' someone has said, so we look closely at the eyes to see the nature of the soul. ","As the night wind blows, the boughs move to and fro; the rustling, the magic rustling that brings on the dark dream. ","Then we ask, 'Will the sadness that makes me cry, will the sadness that makes me cry my heart out, will it ever end?'  ","We write things down sometimes – letters, words – hoping they will serve us and those with whom we wish to communicate. ","Finally, when one head wasn't looking, the other shot the other right between the eyes, and, of course, killed himself. ","This drawer pull - why is it featured so prominently in a life or in a death of one woman who was caught in a web of power? ","Sometimes when we see the eyes – those horrible times when we see the eyes – eyes that have no soul, then we know a darkness. ","The dream of suffering and pain; pain for the victim, pain for the inflicter of pain – a circle of pain, a circle of suffering. ","Of course, eating too little food throws the balance off in the opposite direction, and there is the ill health coming at us again. ","We do have many other types of pie, and at the Double R Diner, Norma knows how to make them all better than anyone I have ever known. ","Each day, just when we think we have a handle on things, suddenly some new element is introduced and everything is complicated once again. ","Happiness, usually classified as a positive emotion, can bring good health to our body, and spread positive vibrations into our environment. ","This is – of course – only a temporary solution to a problem which is going to keep returning, and sometimes these temporary solutions are worse for us than the original problem. "]
