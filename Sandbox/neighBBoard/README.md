# neighBBoard - Neighborhood Bulletin Board  
Here is where we invite any and all MUDDLErs to share their creative process witht the rest of the MUDDLE community. This directory is a place for reflection and is meant to always be in flux.  As MUDDLErs contribute to documenting their interactions with MUDDLE, editors will redistribute materials from the bulletin board into the house. All documentation is ingested: side of bacon with your yolk, pleaseeeee!
