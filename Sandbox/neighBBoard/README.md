# neighBBoard - Neighborhood Bulletin Board  
Here is where we invite any and all muddlers to process. This is a shared directory where artists/authors can contribute their process documentation to the MUDDLE community. This directory acts as a place of reflection and is meant to always be in flux.  As MUDDLErs contribute to documenting their interactions with MUDDLE editors will redistribute materials from the bulletin board into the house. All documentation is ingested. Side of bacon with your yolk, pleaseeeee!
