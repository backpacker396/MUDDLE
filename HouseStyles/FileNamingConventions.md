# G{e|i}tting Started in the Sandbox

## File Naming Conventions
  
Each creator should first add a new directory|folder to the Sandbox of their Forked MUDDLE repo with their creator name as the folder name. Do not add spaces between name parts. If creators wish to indicate a multi-word name please use hyphens `-`, underscores `_`, or camelCase to separate words.   

> So if a creator wishes to be called Anonymous Author you][thei}r folder in the Sandbox could read `AnonymousAuthor`, `anonymousAuthor`, `anonymous_author`, `anonymous_Author`, `anonymous-author`, or `anonymous-Author`.   
  
Every creator will then create children directories|folders for each of the pieces of art/writing they|you wish to contribute to the sandbox within their "creator-named folder". All folders and files within the "creator-named folder" should follow the same naming convention of no spaces within the file/folder names.  (:arrow_down:reference image:arrow_down:)

## Tracking versions

There are two ways to track versions of your content.  
1. **Name each version the same "piece-title" and then append `_version` followed by the version number for each time the piece is updated.** For example, `cartoon_version1` `cartoon_version2`. If you wish to have more than 9 versions of a piece please number each version with a leading `0` or `00` for the earlier versions. For example, `cartoon_version01` `cartoon_version02`.

2. **Keep the exact same file name when saving|uploading|pushing a new version of a piece indicating the version number in the commit message.** (:arrow_down:reference image:arrow_down:)

_*** Note: When keeping versions of non-binary files by utilizing the same filename GitHub offers a unique onion viewer that allows you to see the difference between files/commits overlaid on top of eachother with a transparency slider._

_It is important to realize this method of version-control (via the filename) relies on a creator keeping the filename consistent across versions/updated files/saves. While a filename change is reflected in the larger commit history of a creator's FORKed repo. the commit history for any single file relies on the file keeping the same filename. ***_
